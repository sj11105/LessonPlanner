# Lesson Planner

This project generates lesson planner using Gemini Api which is used by teachers or educators to help them plan their lesson by  providing some inputs about the topic and subject .
## API Reference
How I Integrated the Gemini API
I have integrated Google's Gemini API to generate lesson plans based on user inputs (topic, grade level, subject, etc.).
The integration consists of the following steps:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Obtain an API Key

Go to Google AI Studio
Generate an API key for Gemini
Add it to .env.local in the project
2Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up API Request in GeminiAPI.ts

We make an API request to Gemini using fetch
We send a structured prompt with user inputs
We receive AI-generated content in response
3Ô∏è‚É£ Use API Response in the App

The response is stored in the component state
The lesson plan is displayed in the UI
The user can edit and download it as a PDF


#### Get Generated Plan
